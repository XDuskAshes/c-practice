# Dusk's C Practice

My repository for actively practicing the C language. I may be bad at it, but that's
part of the fun for me. I'm learning, and soon I'll be able to do logical and practical
code with C. All of this is gonna be publically tracked here, as I personally want any
mistakes or 'bad'/'hacky' code to be seen as I keep learning, even if almost nobody
will see it.
